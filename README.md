* [imars-simm/_addSeagrass](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Ftylarmurray%2Fimars-simm%3A_addSeagrass): Core functionality of the SIMM project. Includes function to add a seagrass "band" to a planet superdove image.
* [IMaRS ROIs](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/tylarmurray/rois): "Regions of Interest" including SIMM (and other) data for selected areas. Each ROI should have a consistent structure, enabling hot-swapping of ROIs in scripts. ROIs specifically created for this project (listed below) are verified consistent with SIMM scripts. Other ROIs may not be usable with the SIMM scripts.
